# Quintic_Polynomial_Solver
Generates trajectories for car. The start trajectory is the car's initial vector. The end trajectory is the desired
vector. Time is how long is available to make the change. Code figures out the maneuver that minimizes jerk. (What is jerk? It is the third order derivative of position. In order, position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk.)

A quite usefull chunk of code.
